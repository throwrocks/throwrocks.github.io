![My First Reviewer Certification](http://throw.rocks/android-code-reviews/first-training-certification.PNG)

I'm excited to be starting the path to become an Udacity Android Code Reviewer. Earlier this month, after completing the Android Developer Nanodegree, I wondered what to do with the new skills I learned. At my workplace, we mostly develop in FileMaker Pro and we're so busy with new projects and support that including Android in our stack just because I learned it makes no sense. 

I toyed with the idea of working on side projects and publishing them on the Play Store but I don't really want to develop apps for the consumer market. If I ever develop production apps in Android I will focus on custom business solutions. But at the moment, I just don't want to deal with clients or starting a business or doing contract work. So I started reading about the people who evaluated my projects during the Nanodegree, the Udacity Code Reviewers.

Those anonymous voices who provided me guidance when I was feeling about to break my computer. I remember how frustrated I felt trying to set up the first Content Provider, or when I was struggling to grasp the inner workings of the Broadcast Receiver. But those Code Reviewers helped me stay focused by providing valuable feedback and reasurrance. The Udacity Code Reviewers are a new type of educators, trained in a reviewing method that embraces five simple and powerful guidelines:

1. Simplifying code
2. Practicing kindnesss
3. Explaining why with examples
4. Connecting learners
5. Styling consistently. 

And I just experienced how effective their method is.

Now I look forward to complete more Reviewer Certifications and start working on real code reviews. I look forward to make a difference in the lives of the students who are learning Android to embark in new paths in their careers. And I can do that while practicing my new skills and learning from them without any of the hassles of developing projects on top of my full-time responsibilities at work.
