The new Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree, co-created by Google, is now available for enrollment. This Nanodegree was created to fill the gap between complete beginners and the intermediate Android Developer Nanodegree. 

The only requirements are to be

> ...motivated, and possess basic computer skills like locating and opening files, and downloading and running programs.

The program courses will cover the Java programming language, the Android Studio IDE, and how to start developing Android applications. To sweeten the deal, Udacity is awarding a full scholarship for the Android Developer Nanodegree to the first 50 students who finish. That's an incredible incentive to work hard and complete it fast.

I'm excited for the students who are beginning this program. As a Certified Reviewer, I look forward to help them succeed in their projects.
