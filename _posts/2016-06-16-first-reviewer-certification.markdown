I'm excited to be starting the path to become an Udacity Android Code Reviewer. Earlier this month, after completing the Android Developer Nanodegree, I wondered what to do with the new skills I learned. At my workplace, we mostly develop in FileMaker Pro and we're so busy with new projects and support that including Android in our stack just because I learned it makes no sense. 

I toyed with the idea of working on side projects and publishing them on the Play Store but I don't really want to develop apps for the consumer market. If I ever develop production apps in Android I will focus on custom business solutions. At the moment, I just don't want to deal with clients or starting a business or doing contract work. So I started reading about the people who evaluated my projects during the Nanodegree, the Udacity Code Reviewers.

Those anonymous voices who provided me guidance and reasurrance when I was feeling about to break my computer trying to set up the first Content Provider, or when I was struggling to grasp the inner workings of the Broadcast Receiver. Those Code Reviewers are a new type of educators. They are trained in a reviewing method that embraces five simple and powerful guidelines:

1. Simplifying code
2. Practicing kindnesss
3. Explaining why with examples
4. Connecting learners
5. Styling consistently. 

And I just experienced how effective their method is.

Now I look forward to complete more Reviewer Certifications and start working on some real code reviews. I look forward to making a difference in the lives of the students who are learning Android to embark in new paths in their careers. All while practicing my new skills and learning from others without any of the hassles of developing projects on top of my full-time responsibilities at work.
