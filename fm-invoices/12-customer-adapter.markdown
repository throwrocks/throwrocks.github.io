title: The Customer Adapter

In FileMaker, we display data using Layouts in different View Modes; Form View, List View, and Table View. By setting a Layout to Form View, we get access to the current record in the foundset, and by setting it to List View, we get access to all the records in the foundset. To display data from the records, we insert fields or merge fields that reference the fields from the underlying table occurrence. We can visualize it like this:

[![FileMaker Views][1]][1]

In Android, we have to code the data-binding ourselves. To show a list of items, the most efficient way to implement data-binding is using an Adapter. 

#### Android Adapters

>An Adapter object acts as a bridge between an AdapterView and the underlying data for that view. The Adapter provides access to the data items. The Adapter is also responsible for making a View for each item in the data set.

Notice that an Adapter does two things. It provides access to the data items (in our case, the customer records), and is responsible for making a view for each item in the data set. We already created the "item_customer" layout. Now we have to make the Adapter create one of those layouts for each customer and populate it with the corresponding data. Just like FileMaker, when in Browse Mode, creates one Body part for each record in the foundset and populates the fields and merge fields with data from the table.

Let's visualize how the Adapter will work in our app. I included the API class calling the FileMaker Server so you can see it in context. There's still some missing pieces but we will add them later when we work in our Loader.

#### The RecyclerView

Android has different types of views to present lists of items. For this project, we will use the `RecyclerView`.

>The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView. This widget is a container for displaying large data sets that can be scrolled very efficiently by maintaining a limited number of views.
>
>[Source](https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html#RecyclerView)

To use the `RecyclerView`, we need to add a few dependencies to our app. Add the following lines to your `app/build.gradle` file and then click on *Sync Now*.

```groovy
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:25.0.0'
    compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:25.0.0'
```

#### Implement the RecyclerView in `MainActivity`

In the previous section, we added several <include> tags in our `activity_main.xml` so we could test the `item_customer` layouts. We're going to remove those <include> elements and replace them with a `RecyclerView`. 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/activity_main"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    tools:context="rocks.athrow.fm_invoices.MainActivity">

    <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/customers_list"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:layoutManager="LinearLayoutManager" />
</LinearLayout>
```

#### Create the CustomerAdapter class

First, create a new package to store the adapters.

[![Create new package][3]][3]

[3]: http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_03_create_new_package.png

Name it `adapter`.

[![Name package][4]][4]

[4]: http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_04_name_package.png

Then, create a new Java class inside the `data` package and name it `CustomerAdapter`.

[![New Adapter class][5]][5]

#### Create a ViewHolder inner class that extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder

Now we're going to add the `ViewHolder` inner class to our `CustomerAdapter`. This class will extend the `RecyclerView.ViewHolder` class and we will use it to hold the views from the "item_customer" layout so we can reuse (or recycle) them as the user scrolls through our list.

>A ViewHolder describes an item view and metadata about its place within the RecyclerView.
> RecyclerView.Adapter implementations should subclass ViewHolder and add fields for caching potentially expensive findViewById(int) results.
>
>[Source](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html)

Originally, Android developers created the ViewHolder design pattern to improve the performance of `ListView`. The idea is to store a single reference to the individual views of your layout, and then reuse them as the user scrolls up and down the list instead of creating them again. The Android platform later incorporated the `ViewHolder` pattern into the `RecyclerView`.

Let's create the stub for the `ViewHolder` inner class. 

```java
public class CustomerAdapter {

    public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        // TODO: Declare views
        public ViewHolder(View view) {
            super(view);
            // TODO: Initialize views
        }
    }
}
```

We will fill in the TODOs shortly. First, let's set up the entire Adapter class.

#### Extend RecyclerView.Adapter

Now that we've implemented the `ViewHolder inner` class, we can extend the `CustomerAdapter` to become a subclass of `RecyclerView.Adapter`.

```java
public class CustomerAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<CustomerAdapter.ViewHolder> {
    //...
}
```

Now you should see some red in your class, that's Android Studio warning you that you are missing some required methods to be able to extend `RecyclerView.Adapter`. Let me show you how to figure out what methods are needed and how to include them.

#### Create the required Override methods

Because we are subclassing `RecyclerView.Adapter`, we need to implement some required methods. I will show you how to figure out what methods are required by using the Android Studio warnings. 

You will see that the class name is now underlined in red. If you hover your mouse over it, you will see a message that says "Class CustomerAdapter must either be declared abstract of implement abstract method `onBindViewHolder(VH, int)` in 'Adapter'`.

[![Required OnBindViewHolder][6]][6]
    
[6]: http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_06_required_onbindviewholder.png

Right click on the editor, then click *Generate*.

[![Generate][7]][7]

[7]: http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_07_generate.png

Click on *Override Methods*.

[![Override Methods][8]][8]

[8]: http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_08_override_methods.png

Then select `onBindViewHolder(VH, int)` and click *Ok*.
[![Generate OnBindViewHolder][9]][9]

Now you will see that Android Studio added the  `onBindViewHolder()` method. Click on the class name and you will see that now you need to implement `getItemCount()`.

[9]: http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_09_generate_onbindviewholder.png

[![Required GetItemCount][10]][10]
    
[10]: http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_10_required_getitemcount.png

Right click on the editor, click on *Generate*, then *Override Methods* and select `getItemCount()`.

[![Generate GetItemCount][11]][11]

[11]: http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_11_generate_getitemcount.png.png

Hover over the class name again and you will see that you need to implement `onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup, int)`.

![Required OnCreateViewHolder](http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_12_required_oncreateviewholder.png)

Right click on the editor, click on *Generate*, then *Override Methods* and select `onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup, int)`.

![Generate OnCreateViewHolder](http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_13_generate_oncreateviewholder.png.png)

Now you will see that the warning is gone. That means that your class has all the required components. It should look like this:

![All Required Methods](http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_14_all_required_methods.png.png)

#### Create the constructor

Since our adapter will need the customer data to set the views, we need to create a class variable to hold it. Let's add a `JSONArray` private field named `mCustomers` to our class:

```java
public class CustomerAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<CustomerAdapter.ViewHolder> {
    private JSONArray mCustomers;
    ....
```

Now let's create a constructor. You can add a constructor by right clicking on the editor, clicking on *Generate*, then *Constructor*.

Select the `mCustomers field and click *Ok*.

![Generate Constructor](http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_15_constructor.png)

Your constructor should look like this:

```java
    public CustomerAdapter(JSONArray mCustomers) {
        this.mCustomers = mCustomers;
    }
```

You can also write your constructor from scratch without using the *Generate* function.


#### The CustomerAdapter template

At this point we have the entire structure of our adapter class. It should look like this:

```java
public class CustomerAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<CustomerAdapter.ViewHolder> {
   // A variable to store the customers data
   private JSONArray mCustomers;
   
   // The constructor to create CustomerAdapter objects
   public CustomerAdapter(JSONArray customers) {
        this.mCustomers = customers;
    }

    // The ViewHolder class to hold references to our views
    public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        // TODO: Declare views
        public ViewHolder(View view) {
            super(view);
            // TODO: Initialize views
        }
    }

    // A method to bind the views with the customers data
    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {

    }

    // A method to get the number of records in our data set
    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        return 0;
    }

    // A method to create a ViewHolder object
    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Now let's flesh out `ViewHolder` class and the required methods and explain what their purpose is.

#### Complete the ViewHolder inner class

First, we declare the class fields. We need fields for our views, and a field for the data. The three views that we need to bind the data with are `TextView`, as defined in our `item_customer.xml` layout. So we declare those first. Then, we declare a `JSONObject` field to hold a customer record.


```java
    public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        TextView companyView;
        TextView nameView;
        TextView cityView;
        JSONObject customerRecord;

        public ViewHolder(View view) {
            super(view);
            companyView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.item_customer_company);
            nameView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.item_customer_name);
            cityView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.item_customer_city);
        }
    }
```

Finally, we initialize the views in the constructor. Notice that the constructor accepts a `View` object. That `View` object will be an instance of our `item_customer` layout. To initialize our view variables, we use the `findviewById()` method on the `View` object. 

>##### findViewById()
>
>Look for a child view with the given id. If this view has the given id, return this view.
>
>[Source](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#findViewById(int))

Also, notice the usage of `R.id`.

>##### R.id
>
>When your application is compiled, aapt generates the R class, which contains resource IDs for all the resources in your res/ directory.
>
>[Source](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/accessing-resources.html)

In other words, all the resource ids, like your view ids, are stored in a generated class called `R`. You can then reference the ids through the `R` class.

Now, let's look at the `ViewHolder` and the `item_customer` layout side by side so you can see how they relate to each other.

![ViewHolder references our Layout](http://throw.rocks/fm-invoices/12_customer_adapter/customer_adapter_16_data_binding.png)

#### OnCreateViewHolder

This method will "inflate" the `item_customer.xml` layout and use the resulting `View` object to create a `ViewHolder` object. It's important to note that Android doesn't render the UI from the XML directly. It uses the XML to create view objects and then renders the UI from them. See the documentation on `LayoutInflater`.

>##### LayoutInflater
>
>Instantiates a layout XML file into its corresponding View objects. 
>
>[Source](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/LayoutInflater.html)

Here our complete method.

```java
    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        // Create a new View variable and set it to the result of inflating the item_customer.xml layout.
        View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())
                .inflate(R.layout.item_customer, parent, false);
        // Create a new ViewHolder object using the view variable and return it
        return new ViewHolder(view);
    }
```
Let's step through it. First, we create the `View` variable `view` and set it to the resulting `View` object of the `LayoutInflate.inflate()` method. We pass the `item_customer.xml` layout as an argument to the `inflate()` method. Finally, we return a new `ViewHolder` object created from the `view` variable.


#### OnBindViewHolder

This method handles the data-binding.

```java
    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {
        try {
            // Get the customer record
            holder.customerRecord = mCustomers.getJSONObject(position);
            // Set the variables for our views
            String company = holder.customerRecord.getString("Company");
            String firstName = holder.customerRecord.getString("First");
            String lastName = holder.customerRecord.getString("Last");
            String city = holder.customerRecord.getString("City");
            // Set out views using the variables
            holder.companyView.setText(company);
            holder.nameView.setText(firstName + " " + lastName);
            holder.cityView.setText(city);
            // In case we can't parse the JSON, throw an exception
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            Log.e(CustomerAdapter.class.getName(), "Error: " + e);
        }
    }
```

First, we set the `customerRecord` field to the `JSONObject` in the current position. We use `getJSONObject()`, the same method we used to parse the JSON in the Unit test. Then, we set all the variables that we need by using the `getString` method and passing the corresponding field names - like "Company", "First", "Last", etc. After setting the variables, we set the views with them. We use the `setText()` method to set the data in the views.

#### getItemCount()

This method simply returns the number of records in our data set. This is how the adapter knows how many times to iterate through our data set.

```java
    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        // If the mCustomers variable is null, the count is 0
        if (mCustomers == null) {
            return 0;
        // Otherwise, get the mCustomers length
        } else {
            return mCustomers.length();
        }
    }
```

#### The complete CustomerAdapter

After filling in all the methods, your complete class should look like this:

```java
package rocks.athrow.fm_invoices.adapter;

import android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView;
import android.util.Log;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.ViewGroup;
import android.widget.TextView;

import org.json.JSONArray;
import org.json.JSONException;
import org.json.JSONObject;

import rocks.athrow.fm_invoices.R;

public class CustomerAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<CustomerAdapter.ViewHolder> {
    private JSONArray mCustomers;

    public CustomerAdapter(JSONArray mCustomers) {
        this.mCustomers = mCustomers;
    }

    public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        TextView companyView;
        TextView nameView;
        TextView cityView;
        JSONObject customerRecord;

        public ViewHolder(View view) {
            super(view);
            companyView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.item_customer_company);
            nameView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.item_customer_name);
            cityView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.item_customer_city);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {
        try {
            holder.customerRecord = mCustomers.getJSONObject(position);
            String company = holder.customerRecord.getString("Company");
            String firstName = holder.customerRecord.getString("First");
            String lastName = holder.customerRecord.getString("Last");
            String city = holder.customerRecord.getString("City");
            holder.companyView.setText(company);
            holder.nameView.setText(firstName + " " + lastName);
            holder.cityView.setText(city);
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            Log.e(CustomerAdapter.class.getName(), "Error: " + e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        if (mCustomers == null) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return mCustomers.length();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())
                .inflate(R.layout.item_customer, parent, false);
        return new ViewHolder(view);
    }
}
```

#### Congratulations!

You have completed an Adapter class that will allow you to bind the data from FileMaker with the views in your Customers List. Let's now develop a `Data Loader`, the class that will call the API and pass the data to the Adapter.
